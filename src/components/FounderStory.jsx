          As a college student, I saw talented people across campuses struggling
          to find internships, communities, and opportunities. Everything was
          scattered across groups and random platforms.

        <p className="mt-6 text-lg md:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          I built CampusVerse to bring it all into one place. I designed the UI,
          built the backend, and shipped it as a real product used by real
          students.

          Today I focus on building scalable full-stack products that are fast,
          clean, and actually used. I care about product, engineering, and
          impact.
